<p>But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt I heard God's spirit beckoning me. The children of America are not those kids, they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st century economy. On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people - Muslims and Christians - have suffered in pursuit of a homeland. The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim-majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai.

America, our work will not be easy. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. Americans are ready to join with citizens and governments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.

That's why I've been fighting to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and the minimum wage. And Ashley asks him why he's there. We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. America, this is one of those moments.

But it also means binding our particular grievances - for better health care, and better schools, and better jobs - to the larger aspirations of all Americans - the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man whose been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings.

It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems.

Thank you very much everybody.</p>
